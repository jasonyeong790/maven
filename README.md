# Maven Getting Started Guide
This guide is intended as a reference for those working with Maven for the first time, but is also intended to serve as a cookbook with self-contained references and solutions for common use cases. For first time users, it is recommended that you step through the material in a sequential fashion. For users more familiar with Maven, this guide endeavours to provide a quick solution for the need at hand. It is assumed at this point that you have downloaded Maven and installed Maven on your local machine. If you have not done so please refer to the Download and Installation instructions.

Ok, so you now have Maven installed and we're ready to go. Before we jump into our examples we'll very briefly go over what Maven is and how it can help you with your daily work and collaborative efforts with team members. Maven will, of course, work for small projects, but Maven shines in helping teams operate more effectively by allowing team members to focus on what the stakeholders of a project require. You can leave the build infrastructure to Maven!
